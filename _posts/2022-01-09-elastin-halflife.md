title: The half-life of an age related protein
categories: [Science, Proteomics]
excerpt: Elastin, a protein involved in tissue elasticity, is mainly degrades 
---
As a Sunday morning project, I have tried to resolve a question that has been bothering me for some time.

First some background. The issue is about Elastin, a protein that plays a mayor role in tissue elasticity.
I am mainly interested in this protein because of its aging related properties.
As we age, reduced tissue elasticity causes not only visible changes such a wrinkled skin, but is also
involved in debilitating effects resulting from decrease flexibility of tendons and reduced efficiency of lungs.
Therefore, it is interesting to note that -[according to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastin)- the half-life of elastin is 78 years,
a similar time span as during which tissue elasticity degrades.
This lifespan is in stark contrast to most proteins in our body, many of which have lifetimes ranging from minutes to days.

The Wikipedia statement about the half-life of elastin has bothered me for some time already.
Not only the source of the mentioned 78 years, but more importantly, what is meant with the "half-life"?
The term "half-life" originates from research in radioactivity, where it indicates the time is which half of the atoms undergo radioactive decay.
While this is definition is quite clear for radioactive elements, applying the term to proteins seems fuzzy.
Some of the properties to which we could associate "half-life" are:

* Half of the proteins are degraded/converted to constituent components
* Half of the proteins are replaces by newly forms proteins
* The protein lost half of its function (in this case elasticity), for instance by random cleaving or chemical modification.

Luckily, the Wikipedia article contains literature references which may help to resolve these questions. The source
that is referenced is [a publication from 2013 by Toyama and Hetzer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570024), which specifically
lists Elastin with a "lifetime" of 78 years instead of using the name "half-life"
(the "lifetime" name was apparently used intentionally, as the publication lists other proteins using the word "half-life").
For now, this ends the quest for the meaning of "half-life".

The remaining question, where does the 78 years lifespan of Elastin come from,
should be answered by source from which Toyama and Hetzer obtained the lifetime,
[a publication from 1991 by Shapiro et. al.](https://doi.org/10.1172/jci115204).
In this this publication, it is described how the age of Elastin from lung tissue was measured using 2 methods,
namely aspartic acid racemization and Carbon 14 aging.
The Elastin lifetime that was obtained using the first method is not directly presented as a time span.
For the C14 method, the publication describes a "mean carbon residence time" of 74 year, with 95% confidence limits of 40 to 174 year.
There is no mention of a 78 year lifespan of Elastin in this publication.

Thus, the 78 year half-life of Elastin mentioned in Wikipedia is the result from 2 mix-ups or typos:

. the name "half-life" was used instead of "lifetime"
. the period should not be 78 years, but 74 years (with a very large uncertainty)

The main conclusion from this Sunday morning project is that the time dependency of Elastin changes deserves some further
(literature) study.
